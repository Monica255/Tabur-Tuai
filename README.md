# TaburTuai Android App

TaburTuai is a startup aiming to bring smart farming to local farmers in South Sulawesi. Our Android app helps farmers manage their farms remotely using IoT technology. With this app, farmers can control devices and check the temperature and humidity right from their phones. Additionally, they can access weather forecasts and other data from BMKG (Badan Meteorologi, Klimatologi, dan Geofisika) to plan their farming activities effectively.
